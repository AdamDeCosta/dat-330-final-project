You are enough
You are like a ray of sunshine on a  dreary day
You look great today
Our school is better because you are part of it
You are an excellent friend
That color looks great on you
I am really glad we met
You are beautiful inside and out
Your smile lights up the room
You have beautiful hair
I want to grow up to be just like you
You inspire me to be a better robot
You are so kind
I believe in you
Never stop being you
You light up a room
You bring out the best in people
You are inspiring
You are a smart cookie
You have really cute elbows
I love your shoes
You are thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
