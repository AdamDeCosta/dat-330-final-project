## Branches

Please have **one** branch for your feature. The name of the branch should be identifiable as your feature. As an example, object detection should be named something similar to `object-detection`. 

## Pull Requests & Code Reviews

To ensure code correctness, readability, and proper functionality between branches, I am requiring code reviews to pass before the branch can be merged into `master`. When the team has decided the code is complete and ready to be merged, have **one** member open a [pull request](https://github.com/AdamDeCosta/dat-330-final-project/pulls) and assign the Product Owner (@AdamDeCosta) as a reviewer. Once you have done so, the product owner will conduct the code review and if it passes, the branch will be merged into `master`. Otherwise, the reviewer will request changes and wait for changes to be made before re-reviewing and merging code.

## Issues

For each feature, I will create an [Issue](https://github.com/AdamDeCosta/dat-330-final-project/issues), any discussion about feature implementation, interaction between other features, and general questions related to the feature should take place in the Issue.
